# Gamma Shifter
A client-side Fabric mod that restores the ability to set the gamma (brightness) setting beyond 100% in Minecraft 
1.19+ and adds other customizable quality-of-life features.

Gamma Shifter is no longer in active development and I do not plan to continue adding features to or working on this mod
except to fix bugs and update to new Minecraft versions.

## Features
-Gamma settings can be changed with hotkeys without pausing the game<br>
-Auto Night Mode to automatically toggle FullBright at night <br>
-Customizable mod properties through ModMenu/Cloth Config API implementation <br>
-Adds hotkeys to set 100% and 2000% brightness instantly <br>
-Adds custom presets <br>
